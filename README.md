# 2048
The idea of the project was to code yet another 2048 game in a smart way instead of using some straightforward brute force.<br>
I didn't use any libraries, only vanilla combination of HTML, CSS and typescript and vite as a build tool. Besides, GitHub actions and pages provide easy release system.<br>
This project helped me to gain deeper understanding of canvas animations and gave the opportunity to test my algorithmic skills outside leetcode =)

You can [play the game here](https://stanislav-korneev.github.io/2048/).<br>
For those who care, you can see my development notes and plan [here in figma](https://www.figma.com/file/q8TyyaTuoWw1zYKpwTf36G/Untitled?type=whiteboard&node-id=0-1&t=tUiljxydjekGCOxJ-0). It differs a lot from the final result but might be of interest regarding development process.<br>
